lThis is brushed version of simonk motor controller for atmega8.

tested with afro nfet, and bs nfet esc

The following variables from the ESC configuration tp_net.inc files are not used and can be disregarded 
when adapting the configuration to a new ESC model:
USE_INT0, USE_I2C, USE_UART, USE_ICP, mux_a, mux_b, mux_c, c_comp, mux_voltage, O_POWER, O_GROUND, 


For blue series, bootloader is not loaded,
Solder to 6 pins on blueseries ESC, and connect to arduino
connect pins D10, D11, D12, D13, 5v, GND to breakout pads on bs esc
load arduino isp sketch to arduino
test programmer: (sometimes takes multiple tries)
  avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m8 -U flash:r:flash.hex:i -U eeprom:r:eeprom.hex:i
load brushless controller:
  avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m8 -U flash:w:bs_nfet.hex:i
1 wire bootloader is now programmed



For Afro ESC or bs ESC with afro bootloader
Load arduinoisplinker sketch to arduino
connect pin D2 to signal wire, 5v, and gnd
Load brushed controller:
"make upload_bs" or "make upload_afro" from tgy_brushed
