tested with afro nfet, and bs nfet esc

For blue series, bootloader is not loaded,
Solder to 6 pins on blueseries ESC, and connect to arduino
connect pins D10, D11, D12, D13, 5v, GND to breakout pads on bs esc
load arduino isp sketch to arduino
test programmer:
  avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m8 -U flash:r:flash.hex:i -U eeprom:r:eeprom.hex:i
load brushless controller:
  avrdude -c avrisp -b 19200 -P /dev/ttyUSB1 -u -p m8 -U flash:w:bs_nfet.hex:i
1 wire bootloader is now programmed



For Afro ESC or bs ESC with afro bootloader
Load arduinoisplinker sketch to arduino
connect pin D2 to signal wire, 5v, and gnd
